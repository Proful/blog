        <h2>Begining</h2>
        <p>
          Practice once done for a long period of time one reaches the state of
          mind which is state where one control over desire.
        </p>
        <p>Sadhna - constant remembrance.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Eshwara</strong> - distinguished sense of Self. Seed of all
          knowledge. Guru who illuminate
        </p>
        <p>
          Not able to give up. Inability to be firm and falling back. Obstacles
          - laziness. Outcome - depression, suffering - result of scattered
          mind.
          <em>One pointed focus and practice.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          State of neutrality. Happiness vs Sadness. By practice you can be
          bright state of mind all the time. Attached with or averse to. Sadhna
          and Dream. Putting into practice by Kriya yoga you can attain the
          state. Hata yoga, chita yoga, bhakti yoga, kriya yoga, karma yoga.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dhyana. Calmness. One who control self, doesn't bother about
          <em>minute</em> or bigger issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kriya yoga - to bring out purpose. To experience the state of
          <em>samadhi</em> and to cleanse out obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Obstacles</strong> - ignorance (abidya), wrong identification
          with self, affection, aversion, being strongly attached. Abidya
          (ignorance) - sleeping, present in small amount, intermittent, in full
          force.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The root cause to all the obstacles is <em>abidya or ignorance</em>.
            Thinking temporary thing as permanent. Like body is temporary,
            thinking it will last foreever is ignorance. Everything physical in
            this world is temporary.
          </li>
          <li>Pleasant experience/craving for samething.</li>
          <li>Sad experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Removal of obstacles possible through <em>Dhyana</em>.</p>
        <p>
          Root of all obstacles is your <em>Karma</em> in this life or past
          lives. Viveka - to discern, able to logically analyse cause sorrow.
          Who able to apply viveka cause both happiness and sorrow.
        </p>
        <h3>How to remove obstacles?</h3>
        <p>Don't wait for sorrow to come. Fix it before. Not clear.</p>
